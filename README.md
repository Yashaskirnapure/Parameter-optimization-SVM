**Support Vector Machines** (SVMs) are supervised learning models in machine learning that employ associated learning algorithms to analyze data for classification and regression tasks. They seek to identify a hyperplane that effectively separates two classes or maximizes the margin between classes. SVMs are particularly suited for smaller datasets.

**Parameter Optimization**
Optimization of parameter values means finding the best combination of the parameters that governs the model, to enable it to perform the given task with relative accuracy.
